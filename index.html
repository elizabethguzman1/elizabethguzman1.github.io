        <p class="lead mb-4">Undergraduate student attending their first year at the University of California Riverside as a Political Science / Public Service major. Hoping to not only excel academically but also add to her work experience by obtaining career-building opportunities such as internships and research positions in fields related to their area of study. Currently has a 3.3 GPA and is involved in the school's Student Chicano Program. Has skills in customer service, public speaking, comprehension, and flexibility when it comes to being open to new experiences and opportunities.<br><br>

        Has experience in several volunteer positions in and out of school. During High School, I was a part of two programs, the National Honor Society and Link Crew, for about 3 years. In the National Honor Society, I directly helped out the community of my high school by participating in promotional activities that highlighted the importance of community service and club involvement. As a Link Leader in the Link Crew program, I was in charge of serving as a mentor to the incoming freshmen students, as a way to make the transition into high school as smooth as possible. During my involvement in these organizations, I was able to really build on my skill of public speaking and leadership since we would be put in positions where we had to address big crowds of people during events, whether it be students, parents, or important individuals who were visiting the school. This also made me feel more involved in my school and as if I actually mattered since I was making a change/ and or having an influence on it by running and organizing events and activities that were aimed at building more of a community on our campus. Outside of school, I was a part of a volunteer youth group that represents the county of Riverside called Riverside Countyâ€™s 5th District Youth Group. Here I would attend several volunteer opportunities throughout the county, whether it be at different schools, local clean-ups, or any other social/communal event that was going on at the moment. My involvement in this group opened up so many opportunities for me to get to know more people throughout my county and have a better understanding of how local government works. It was ultimately my involvement in this group that I decided that I would like to get involved in local government as my career, and decided to major in political science / public service.<br><br>

        When it comes to actual work experience I have only held one temporary position as a cashier at a WinCo Foods grocery store. Here I was able to learn actual customer service skills as I helped customers check out, answered their questions, assisted in any help customers needed, and learned how to handle money and a till properly. I was also faced with several instances where I was able to handle difficult situations in the most professional manner possible, to carry out my job responsibilities while also making the customer feel understood. This job also taught to me what it means to work in exchange for a paycheck, and introduced me to the world of adulting.
